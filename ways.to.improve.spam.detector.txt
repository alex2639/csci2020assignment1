Ways to improve the spam detector

Have certain words have more of an effect on determining likelihood of spam.
For example, the words "buy" , "sale" , "free" are associated with advertisements which is a form of spam.
If such words were to appear in an e-mail, there would be a higher chance of such e-mail being spam
compared to other words that may appear.

Determine how the words are used in context. For instance, the word "buy". The word can be used in
different context. For advertisements which is associated with spam, "Buy now, and save 50%".
In ham messages, "Go to the grocery store and buy some eggs". The words used in a certain context would
have a lower chance of being spam while the same word being used in a different context would have a
higher chance of being spam.
